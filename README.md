# Operating-Systems

Low-level code projects solving classical OS problems and optimizations, implements OS mechanisms. Mostly done in C; Java and Python scripts also available.

1. Tarea 1: Use of fork system calls to create a fork tree. Implementation of the copy command through system calls. Implementation of -ls terminal command through system calls.
2. Scheduling Algorithms: Creation of a scheduler simulator that uses different scheduling algorithms in order to compare throughput and turnaround metrics. Implements 3 different scheduling algorithms along with interrupts.
3. Dining Philosophers: Classical resource sharing problem solved in Java allowing parallelism.
